            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>I was born in Northeast China, right on the border between China
            and North Korea. For some reason, I found myself zig-zagging in a
            easterly direction, finishing my high school in Northeast China,
            and across the Pacific, I got my B.S. from Cal State, East Bay
            in California. I migrated on to graduate school at Utah, completing
            a Ph.D. with Scott L. Anserson in 2016, then I joined Sylvia T.
            Ceyer's lab as a postdoc at MIT in 2017.</p>
            <p>Apart from my research in the field of surface chemistry, I also
            enjoy brewing beer, and learning some cool stuff about Python, or
            computer programming in general. I have to say, it is a good time
            now to be a computer programmer.</p>
